                    <p>
                        HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] 
with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014. 
Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and 
other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently 
understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's 
rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume 
not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.

                        HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; 
it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup 
and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[7] For the same reasons, 
HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed 
with low-powered devices in mind.
