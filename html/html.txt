Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.

A graduate of Oxford University, Sir Tim invented the Web while at CERN, 
the European Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first web 
client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and HTML were 
refined as Web technology spread.

On 4 April 2017, Sir Tim was awarded the ACM A.M. Turing Prize for inventing 
the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and 
algorithms allowing the Web to scale. The Turing Prize, called the "Nobel Prize 
of Computing" is considered one of the most prestigious awards in Computer Science.

The Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup language 
used to create hypertext documents that are platform independent. 
HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are 
appropriate for representing information from a wide range of domains. 
HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and hypermedia; 
menus of options; database query results; simple structured documents with in-lined graphics; 
and hypertext views of existing bodies of information.

HTML has been in use by the World Wide Web (WWW) global information initiative since 1990. 
This specification roughly corresponds to the capabilities of HTML in common use prior to June 1994. 
HTML is an application of ISO Standard 8879:1986 Information Processing Text and Office Systems; 
Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML).

HTML 3.2 is W3C's specification for HTML, developed in early `96 together with vendors including IBM, Microsoft, 
Netscape Communications Corporation, Novell, SoftQuad, Spyglass, and Sun Microsystems. 
HTML 3.2 adds widely deployed features such as tables, applets and text flow around images, 
while providing full backwards compatibility with the existing standard HTML 2.0.

W3C is continuing to work with vendors on extensions for accessibility features, multimedia objects, 
scripting, style sheets, layout, forms, math and internationalization. W3C plans on incorporating 
this work in further versions of HTML.

HTML 4 extends HTML with mechanisms for style sheets, scripting, frames, embedding objects, 
improved support for right to left and mixed direction text, richer tables, and enhancements to forms, 
offering improved accessibility for people with disabilities.

The World Wide Web (Web) is a network of information resources. 
The Web relies on three mechanisms to make these resources readily available to the widest possible audience:

A uniform naming scheme for locating resources on the Web (e.g., URIs).
Protocols, for access to named resources over the Web (e.g., HTTP).
Hypertext, for easy navigation among resources (e.g., HTML).

HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] 
with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[4][5] 
Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and 
other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently 
understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's 
rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume 
not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[6]

HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; 
it extends, improves, and rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup 
and application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web applications.[7] For the same reasons, 
HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile applications because it includes features designed 
with low-powered devices in mind.
